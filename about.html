    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring UI/UX designer currently pursuing an Associate Certificate at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). With a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Simon Fraser University, I bring a unique perspective to design, blending my understanding of human behavior with a passion for creating intuitive user experiences.<br>

    My journey into the world of design is fueled by a fascination with how people interact with technology. I believe that effective design is not just about aesthetics; it’s about understanding the needs and motivations of users to create meaningful solutions. This insight allows me to approach design challenges with empathy and creativity, ensuring that the end product resonates with users on a deeper level.<br>
    
    At BCIT, I am honing my technical skills and exploring the latest design trends and tools. I’m particularly interested in user research and usability testing, as I see them as crucial components in the design process. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others, always striving to push the boundaries of what’s possible in design.<br>
    
    Eager to apply my skills in a professional setting, I am actively seeking opportunities in the industry where I can contribute innovative solutions and enhance user satisfaction. Whether it's through internships or freelance projects, I am committed to growing as a designer and making a positive impact in the field.<br>
    
    Outside of design, you can find me exploring the vibrant landscapes of British Columbia, indulging in photography, or diving into my <a href="#hobbies" title="go to hobbies">hobby</a> of mechanical keyboards. I’m excited about the journey ahead and look forward to connecting with fellow creatives and professionals in the UI/UX community!<br>

<h2>George Guo: A Journey into UX Research</h2>

    As an aspiring UI/UX designer with a background in psychology, my journey into the world of user experience (UX) research has been both exciting and enlightening. With my current studies at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) and a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Simon Fraser University, I am uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between understanding human behavior and creating intuitive digital experiences.

<h3>The Intersection of Psychology and Design</h3>

    My fascination with human behavior has always influenced my approach to design. Psychology provides insight into how users think, feel, and interact with products. This understanding is essential for UX research, where the primary goal is to gather qualitative and quantitative data about user needs, preferences, and pain points. By applying psychological principles, I can create more effective user personas, define user journeys, and develop empathy maps that guide design decisions.<br>

    In my coursework at BCIT, I have delved into various research methods, including usability testing, surveys, and ethnographic studies. Learning how to conduct thorough user interviews has been particularly impactful. I discovered that asking the right questions can reveal not just what users do, but why they do it. This qualitative data is invaluable for informing design choices and ensuring that the final product aligns with user expectations.

<h3>Hands-On Experience: Internship at Tech Innovators Inc.</h3>

    One of the most formative experiences in my journey was my internship at Tech Innovators Inc., a tech startup focused on developing productivity tools. As a UX researcher intern, I was tasked with gathering user insights to inform the redesign of their flagship mobile application.<br>

    My first step was conducting user interviews with existing customers. I developed a semi-structured interview guide that allowed me to probe deeper into users' motivations and frustrations. I was surprised to find that while users appreciated the app's functionality, they often felt overwhelmed by its complexity. This feedback led us to prioritize simplification in our design strategy.<br>

    I also facilitated usability testing sessions, where users interacted with both the current app and our prototype. Observing their behavior in real time was enlightening. I noted where users hesitated, struggled, or expressed confusion. These insights allowed our team to iterate on the design rapidly, focusing on areas that truly mattered to our users. By the end of the internship, we had produced a more intuitive interface that significantly improved user satisfaction scores.

 <h3>Collaborating with a Nonprofit: A Freelance Project</h3>
    In addition to my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a freelance project for a local nonprofit organization. The organization aimed to revamp their website to increase engagement and donations. As the UX researcher on the project, I conducted a combination of user interviews and surveys to gather data from their target audience.<br>

    Through this research, I discovered that many potential donors were frustrated by the existing website's navigation and lack of clear calls to action. Users expressed a desire for more engaging content that showcased the nonprofit's impact. Armed with this information, I collaborated with a designer to create a more user-friendly website layout, incorporating storytelling elements and visual assets that highlighted the organization's work.<br>

    After launching the redesigned website, we monitored user engagement metrics and observed a 30% increase in online donations within the first three months. This project underscored the significance of user research in driving tangible results and further fueled my passion for making a difference through design.

<h3>Design Challenges at BCIT: Collaborative Learning</h3>
    Participating in design challenges at BCIT has been another enriching aspect of my journey into UX research. One notable challenge involved a team project to develop an educational app aimed at high school students. As the UX researcher, I led the effort to gather insights from our target demographic.<br>

    We began by creating user personas based on demographic data and conducted focus groups to understand students' needs and preferences. The feedback was revealing; students wanted an engaging, gamified experience that would make learning more enjoyable. This insight shaped our design approach and ultimately led to the development of a prototype that included interactive quizzes and rewards for progress.<br>

    Presenting our findings and prototype to industry professionals was a pivotal moment. Their feedback emphasized the importance of usability and accessibility, prompting us to iterate further on our design. This experience highlighted the collaborative nature of UX research and reinforced my belief in the value of diverse perspectives in the design process.

<h3>Embracing the Future of UX Research</h3>
    As I continue my studies and seek further opportunities in the UX industry, I am excited about the evolving landscape of UX research. The integration of new technologies, such as AI and machine learning, presents both challenges and opportunities. Understanding how to leverage these tools to gather and analyze user data will be crucial in the future.

    Moreover, I am particularly interested in the role of ethical considerations in UX research. As designers, we have a responsibility to protect user privacy and ensure that our research practices are transparent and respectful. I believe that ethical UX research not only fosters trust with users but also leads to more meaningful and effective design outcomes.

    
    <h2><a name="hobbies">Hobbies</a></h2>
    <p>
    My passion for design extends beyond the screen; it also encompasses the tactile joy of mechanical keyboards.<br>
    I’ve always been fascinated by the way these keyboards combine functionality and aesthetics, offering a satisfying typing experience that enhances productivity.<br> 
    Each key press feels intentional, and the customizable options allow for a personal touch that mirrors my design philosophy. <br>
    Whether it’s the sound of the switches or the feel of the keycaps, mechanical keyboards inspire me and provide a perfect blend of form and function—just like the user experiences I strive to create as a UI/UX designer.
